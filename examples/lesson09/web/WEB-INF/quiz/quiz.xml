    <ANSWER ISCORRECT="false">When your filter chains to the next filter, it should pass the same arguments it received in its doFilter method.</ANSWER>
    <ANSWER ISCORRECT="true">The method that your filter invokes on the object it received that implements javax.servlet.FilterChain can invoke either another filter or a servlet.</ANSWER>
